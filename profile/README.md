## Buddle Finance
> Cross chain DeFi Products

We are a nextgen cross layer2 bridge allowing for near instant token bridging by leveraging liquidity providers and pools. The core token bridge will also support cross chain dApps such as cross chain borrowing and lending, cross chain token streams, and cross chain swaps. Currently the core token bridge is under active development, to be released on testnets for alpha testing by the end of Q2 2022. Browse through our repositories to see the code until we launch our webapp at `buddle.finance`. We expect to be live on mainnet by the end of 2022.
